    "Overall, this cheese vector approach is intriguing. We tested a simple technique (just run two forward passes while varying an intuitively relevant feature!) and found that it worked. However, we haven't found similarly powerful vectors by e.g. making the cheese closer to the agent. Perhaps we just got lucky. However, there seems like some small hope for something like \"just subtract out the deception by subtracting the deception vector LOL.\""
