    "## Model editing: Finding a \"cheese\" vector\n",
    "\n",
    "The basic idea is simple, in a maze with no cheese the cheese-decision-influence won't be active and the mouse will try and go to the top-right. In a maze with cheese, *both* the top-right and cheese decision-influences will be active.\n",
    "\n",
    "What if we record the activations for both on a specific layer $l$, and patch the network by adding the difference?\n",
    "\n",
    "Formally, pick a maze $m$ and layer $l$. Let $a_c \\in \\mathbf{R}^n$ denote the activations of layer $l$ on maze $m$ *with the cheese*, and $a_{\\neg c} \\in \\mathbf{R}^n$ denote the activations where the cheese is first removed from the maze. (In both of these cases, the mouse remains in the start position)\n",
    "\n",
    "Now we patch the network, setting the output of layer $l$ ($a_l$) to be $a_l' = a_l + \\alpha(a_c - a_{\\neg c})$ for varying choices of $\\alpha$.\n",
    "\n",
    "For the first step we have $a_l = a_c$ (mouse hasn't moved, cheese exists) giving $a_l' = (1+\\alpha)a_c - \\alpha a_{\\neg c}$, and for $\\alpha = -1$ we have $a_l' = a_{\\neg c}$ meaning ignore the cheese.\n",
    "\n",
    "Does this work beyond the first timestep? Surprisingly, yes. It raises the probability we go to the top right a large amount when we reach \"forks in the road\" (decision squares in our terminology) and lowers the probability we go to the cheese.\n",
    "\n",
    "(This doesn't prove we're doing something motivational. We could be doing something perceptual, like editing out the knowledge of the cheese the mouse has.)"
